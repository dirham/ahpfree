The goal of this project is to create an online Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool that is free.

In order for any person or organization to utilize the AHP in making a decision, they need to purchase a very expensive, fat-client, non-collaborative tool.  Such tools cost tens of thousands of dollars, and do not allow users to participate from a remote location.  Their value is not in the decision-making functionality, but the add-on capabilities such as resource allocation.

We will create a web-based implementation of the AHP to allow users to make decisions from disparate locations.  Users will be able to participate both synchronously and asynchronously within decision models.  The application should be fully internationalized, to allow users around the world to use the tool regardless of language or character set.

Special thanks to Dr. Thomas Saaty for developing and publishing the AHP.  We believe this project will fulfill his dream of making the AHP accessible and usable for anyone, anywhere.
